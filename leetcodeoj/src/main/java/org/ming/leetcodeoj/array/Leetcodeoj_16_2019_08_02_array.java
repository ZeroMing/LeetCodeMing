    /**
     * Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target,
     * find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
     * Return the sum of the three integers.
     * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
     *
     * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
